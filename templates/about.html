<span class="text">The five ML methods used are random forest, k-nearest neighbors,
      Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine, and elastic net logistic regression. Each can be
       performed with 3 different gene sets as features containing 7, 168, and 960 genes, respectively.
       By default, all ML methods and the 2 larger gene sets are used. The 7 gene set is only recommended
       if the full transcriptome is not available.
       </br></br>Batch effects, if present, are adjusted using ComBat. The classifier has been validated using RNA-seq
       data from a mixture of fresh frozen and FFPE tumor samples. Compared to the original clustering-based
       subtype definition, it correctly classifies all original 18 UM and 66 TCGA samples tested.
