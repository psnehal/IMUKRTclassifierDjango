<b>Background:</b>
HPV-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are classified into two main tumor subtypes: IMU and KRT, which have been validated by several studies.  Knowing the subtype of each tumor is important for research, due to their distinct tumor biology and clinical outcomes.

This IMU/KRT classifier uses five well-trained machine learning (ML) models with majority voting to classify the subtype of each HPV+ HNSCC sample.
